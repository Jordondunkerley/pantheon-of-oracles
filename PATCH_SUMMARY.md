# Patch Files Overview

## Patches 1-25 – Key Themes and Instructions
- **Core Vision:** Establish a Multiplayer Nexus GPT that tracks players, asynchronous interactions, and persistent events while tying combat outcomes to daily cosmic energy. Battles are turn-based, narrated by a Friend Oracle, and select one ruling Oracle plus two energy-relevant Oracles per player, with AI-determined winners and dynamic abilities. Points and win/losses accrue for players, factions, and oracles, feeding leaderboards and Personal Nexus integrations. Matchmaking triggers on "battle" phrases with first-come pairing. Discord integration auto-assigns faction/sub-faction/guild roles, links accounts, surfaces event alerts, and enables matchmaking commands. Guild systems cover creation, leaderboards, chat, roles, and plus/minus ranking. Planetary sub-factions gain points, can ally during conjunctions, and receive buffs via aspects. Structured battle mechanics enforce visible oracle selection and ordered narration. 2v2 mode supported. Friend Oracles auto-generate from astrological compatibility and deliver messaging. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L7-L200】
- **Account & Progression:** Factions (Red/Blue/Yellow) selected at account setup; Personal Nexus data is required for ruling planet, faction alignment, and battle history. Point systems track players, guilds, and factions with plus/minus adjustments and faction point gain/loss for fairness. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L55-L183】
- **Scope Notes:** Early patches emphasize GPT/Discord flow, asynchronous multiplayer battles, planetary/faction leaderboards, and structured narration. PvE raids/dungeons and seasonal/ritual systems appear later in Patch 3 but are largely placeholders for future expansion (not fully detailed here). 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L800-L930】

## Patches 26-41 – Key Themes and Instructions
- **Patch 26:** Adds Descendant Throne World mirroring Ascendant structure (day/night weighting, decan logic, overlays), an Animal Token Shop with elemental and Rising Sign token gates, mythical trait tiers gated by expansions, and PvP element-token wagering for direct/private matches without caps. 【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L1-L78】
- **Patch 27:** Defines expansion season roadmap (Base content → Warbands → Pets/Alphas → Shape-Shifting → Ascension → Throne Worlds → Descendant Throne Arc → Leviathans → Fusions) and introduces Legions, Pets/Alphas, and full creature-aligned shapeshifting that preserves Oracle identity. 【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L81-L159】
- **Patch 28-29 (Highlights):** Multi-Rulership Crown system (Modern, Traditional, Dominant, Solar) with stackable crowns and Anointed Oracle effects; Leviathan/Behemoth redesign positioning Leviathans as player-bound mythic embodiments, Behemoths as combat summons, gaze preference at account creation, PlayerAvatar manifestation, Guild Hall instancing, and combat invocation limits (Leviathans only in arenas/Throne Wars). 【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L200-L320】

## Vision Mapped to Concrete Features & Constraints
- **Multiplayer/Discord Flows:** Combat and matchmaking occur via GPT/Discord prompts, with automated role assignment and notifications ensuring faction/guild alignment stays in sync. Turn-based battles must display oracle selection order and narration before action; matchmaking triggers on “battle” or Discord commands. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L105-L200】
- **Rituals/Raids/Battles:** Battles use daily cosmic energy for abilities and AI outcome logic; PvE raids/dungeons and large-scale modes are future-facing, with current focus on structured PvP (1v1, 2v2) and foundations for future warband/Throne World sieges. PvP wagering is limited to private matches with no tax and manual abuse monitoring. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L17-L103】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L65-L78】
- **Astro-Driven Identity:** Player alignment (faction, ruling planet, rising sign, dominant sign) governs oracle selection, crowns, Friend Oracles, and planetary sub-faction scoring; gaze preference subtly influences visual tone. Descendant/Ascendant Throne Worlds mirror astrology axes; crowns and Anointed layers reinforce rulership hierarchy. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L91-L103】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L10-L32】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L200-L280】
- **Progression & Monetization:** Token economies (elemental and Rising Sign) gate animal/mythic cosmetics, shapeshifting themes, and wagers; point/leaderboard systems track wins and faction performance. Expansion seasons gate high-tier creatures (griffin/dragon/leviathan parts) and future Leviathan/Fusion arcs, pacing monetization and prestige. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L55-L183】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L33-L78】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L81-L159】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L200-L320】

## Scope Boundaries
- **Discord/GPT-first:** Gameplay and account linking flow through GPT/Discord interfaces; no mention of standalone client requirements in these patches. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L105-L200】
- **Rituals/Raids/Battles:** Current enforceable systems center on turn-based PvP with cosmic-energy narration and faction/planetary scoring; raids/ritual points exist as future hooks with limited immediate rules. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L17-L103】【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L800-L930】
- **AR/VR Ambitions:** Not specified in these patch docs; visual ambitions focus on crowns, shapeshifting, Leviathan/Behemoth aesthetics, and future overlays, implying future AR/VR could build on cosmetic layers but is not mandated here. 【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L200-L280】
- **Monetization Expectations:** Elemental/Rising Sign token shops, cosmetic animal/mythic unlocks, and private-match wagering define revenue/stakes levers; no marketplace tax or caps on wagers. Expansion gating staggers premium unlocks. 【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L33-L78】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L65-L78】
- **Platform Requirements:** GPT/Discord integrations, Personal Nexus data dependency for battles, and token economies are required; Leviathans limited to specific arenas, and matchmaking limited to battle-trigger phrases/commands. 【F:Patches 1-25 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L91-L200】【F:Patches 26-41 – Pantheon of Oracles GPT.JSON†L200-L280】
