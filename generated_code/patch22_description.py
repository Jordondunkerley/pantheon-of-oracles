# Patch: 22
# Description: Enables users to transfer their Pantheon of Oracles system from the custom GPT to their default ChatGPT assistant. This patch guides the user through exporting Oracle profiles, including unique Oracle IDs, and Codex rules, then creates a memory installation script they can paste into ChatGPT to activate their system permanently. Oracle IDs ensure link-back to the Nexus Hub for stat syncing and IP retention.
