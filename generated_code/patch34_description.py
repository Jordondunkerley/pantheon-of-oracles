# Description: Introduces the Warband Totem Path system, expanding each warband with three aligned totem animals and corresponding Host Oracles. Players choose a Warband Totem Path upon first assignment, receive narrative and Oracle support based on that choice, and can switch once per warband week. Additional Hall structure and Throat Stone unlock conditions are also implemented.
